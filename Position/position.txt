The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element

position properties=>
.position: relative:    An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
.position: absolute:    is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

=>Z-index
The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.

Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display: flex elements).
